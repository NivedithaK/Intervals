# Intervals
An interval is the number of semitones between two musical notes. They have special names based on the sound (i.e. major, minor, perfect, 
augmented, diminished). Here is an iOS app that helps you practice identifying intervals! 

# Gameplay

Simply click on the "play" button (multiple times if needed), and then choose an answer. If the answer is correct, your score
will increase by 1 point. If you answered incorrectly, the app will tell you the correct answer so you can learn.

# Next steps

While this was meant to be a quick project, there are many ways to extend it. First, the user should be able to choose 
between solid and broken intervals. There should be a system to generate new interval audio files without having them
pre-uploaded. Lastly, this was an exercise in streaming, but it would be more convenient to have the audio files downloaded 
on the user's phone.
